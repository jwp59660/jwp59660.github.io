	<tr>
		<td style="background-color:#A0522D"> Live Oak plays everything from handmade originals to classic covers. As of now, we have three originals and are working on a few more
		before we record and release them. Many of us having very different musical interests, you may think it would be hard for us to collaborate on what we want to sound like. 
		Although that sometimes does create different sides on things, it actually has done much more in that it brings fresh ideas to the table. For example, while I'm particularly 
		intersted in jazz and progressive rock, some others in the band prefer bands such as The Grateful Dead. Even though I may not be a big fan of the band, those who do enjoy them
		bring a certain sound to our originals, while at the same time I bring inspiration from jazz through my drumming. 
			<p>Consequently, the different musical backgrounds in each member of the band gives Live Oak a unique sound. Be on the look out as we release originals on music platforms soon.
