<h2>Education and Activities Background</h2>
<table border=2>
	<tr> 
		<td style="background-color:#ff3333"> My highschool education began and ended at Westminster Schools of Augusta. While there, I maintained around a 3.75 GPA 
		with a 30 ACT along with playing for the soccer team, which won four consecutive state championships while I was there. While not only participating in other 
		sports at school, I also was apart of Cotillion Club. Unlike Cotillion Club in other cities, the only way to be apart of this organization was through an application
		and successfully completing the dance courses leading up to the club. Once admitted, myself and my peers taught those younger than us how to dance. 
			<p>I am now currently a student at the University of Georgia studying finance. I am involved in Greek Life as a Sigma Chi and often volunteer at the student-led
			radio station WUOG. On top of this, I am the drummer of a band (Live Oak) which plays around Athens and the surrounding community, playing originals as well as 
			covers. </p>

<h2>Experience and Interests in Finance</h2>
<table border=2>
	<tr>
		<td style="background-color:#008000">With my father being a stock broker/investment advisor, I have always had a steady, ample interest in finance. As a freshman
		in  highschool, I had an internship at Raymond James (where my dad worked). While there, I met with the brokers in the Augusta branch as well as the one in Buckhead
		about how they go about doing their job, advise on how to invest in the market, and what it is like to handle clients' money. During this time I was also reading a 
		celebrated book of the finance community: <span style="font-style:italic">Liars Poker</span>. This book was one of the first sources of my love and drive for the 
		business world. Reading about the high-caliber environment of Wall Street, the intense competition between colleagues, and the clear opportunity for success brought
		me to the realization that this is what I wanted to do. 
			<p>In  college, besides taking businesses classes, I subscribe to the Wall Street Breakfast and other websites and articles that further inform me of current events
			and the market that will help me make decisions in investing my money and just give me a clear understanding of where our world is at financially. I plan to join business 
			clubs such as Apollo next fall and an internship next summer.</p>
